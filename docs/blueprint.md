## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Light grayish-blue (#D1DCE5), creating a soft, professional backdrop. The subtle desaturation avoids starkness while harmonizing with the other colors.
- Primary color: Moderate, slightly desaturated blue (#5A87AC), projecting reliability and skill. It provides good contrast against the background without being overwhelming. 
- Accent color: Vibrant pink (#D67DBF), used selectively for highlights and calls to action. It provides a unique, attention-grabbing contrast that matches the user's color request, without overwhelming the site with 'feminine' cliches.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines, and 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text, combining techy precision with modern readability.
- Utilize a set of minimalist, consistent icons, in shades of the primary blue, to visually represent different skills and sections.
- Design a clean, responsive layout that adapts fluidly to various screen sizes, ensuring an optimal user experience on both desktop and mobile.
- Incorporate smooth transitions and subtle animations on page scroll, project hover, and skill bar loading to enhance user engagement.
